# Online CV

*My first online **CV** created with **HTML**, **CSS**, **SCSS**, **JS***.

*In the project used fonts-family of the [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) and also [Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik).*

*The icons were connected to the project using the service of the [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/).*

*The portfolio section has been added as an example :see_no_evil:, i will add my own later.* 

*Connecting the **SCSS** preprocessor of course greatly facilitates the process of work, but some points on it, are not yet fully clear to me.*

*And as the great people said in their time:*

> ***The desire for knowledge is the best of aspirations.***

*So let's move on `to be continued...`*
